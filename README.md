# mod-9-pro-readme-gen

## [![License: APACHE2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License:_MIT-orange)](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)

## Description
* For this project, I will create an application that will enable a user to create a Professional README.md file.
* This application will feature Node.js and use npm dependencies such as inquirer.
* I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
* By building this application, it has helped me to learn information on Node.js, npm, badge maker and other info.

## User Story
AS A developer, I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
